# Contributing

## Principle statement 
This is a statement outlining the purpose of the project. It should be concise and meaningful.

Example: 
"Telegram is a cloud-based mobile and desktop messaging app with a focus on security and speed."
Source: https://telegram.org/

To ensure a project is community based, the principle statement should be informed by the needs of your community (user base).

Here are some resources on conducting research and drawing insight from your community:

## How to Contribute
  - How can people contribute to the project? 
  - Coding standards
  - What do they need to know to get started?
  

## Feature Requests
It's important to clearly outline the criteria in which feature requests are prioritized. In an open-source project, anyone can theoretically work on a feature request. However, that feature may not be accepted by the maintainers. Also, it can be unclear as to the likelihood that someone will work on a request. In a community project it's important for users to know what kind of features will be prioritized in a project as well as receive a response to their request. This empowers users to request relevant features and have the peace of mind that their request will be responded to.

###Feature Criteria
A Feature Criteria outlines the ways in which a feature is assessed as a potentially viable request to be made. One example is Telegram's Feature Philosophy (https://core.telegram.org/tsi/feature_philosophy). However you decide to write this, your Feature Criteria should include the following:

  - List of criteria
  - Decision making process (who can decide whether a feature request is accepted, who can determine the priority of a feature request and what do those priorities mean)
  - Timelines for feature request (when will my feature request be acknowldged)

## Leadership
  - What roles exist in the project?
  - What powers do those roles possess?
  - How do people take on those roles?
  - How do they lose them?
